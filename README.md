## Introduction

Ever wondered how long it would take for the sheriff to catch a speeding car on the highway? This Python mini project uses NumPy and Matplotlib to simulate and visualize the chase.

## Features

- Simulates a speeding car and a pursuing sheriff's car.
- Calculates the time it takes for the sheriff to catch the speeding car.
- Provides visualizations of the chase with Matplotlib.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/brucesailes/Bank-Robber.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Usage

1. Adjust the initial conditions of the chase in the `main.py` script.
2. Run the script to simulate the chase.
3. View the visualizations generated by Matplotlib to see the chase progress and the time it takes for the sheriff to catch the speeding car.
